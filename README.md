It is a Moonlight themed Movie Recommender System based on Content Filtering using Machine Learning Model. This application provides all the details of the requested movie such as overview, genre, release date, rating, runtime, top cast, reviews, recommended movies, etc. 

The movies can be easily found by using the auto-suggestion feature, which can handle and complete the trail of movie even with some typos. The results include a holistic review of the movie along with the sentiment analysis of the comments.

## 'Invalid Request' Error

If you're getting invalid request error in your application, kindly delete the browser cache and retry

## API 

The details of the movie are fetched through an API by TMDB, the movies can be tracked through their IMDB id. `beautifulsoup4` was used to get the reviews from the site by doing web scraping, the reviews are then feeded to the sentiment analyser.
I have not replaced my api key in the app for demonstration purpose.

## How to get the API key?

Create an account in https://www.themoviedb.org/, click on the `API` link from the left hand sidebar in your account settings and fill all the details to apply for API key. If you are asked for the website URL, just give "NA" if you don't have one. You will see the API key in your `API` sidebar once your request is approved.
